    title: I’m a front end react developer.
    subtitle: >-
      I am a passionate Front-End Developer with a strong focus on building
      dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly web applications using React. With
      a solid understanding of modern JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3, and React
      best practices, I have experience in creating seamless user interfaces and
      optimizing web performance.Throughout my career, I’ve delivered
      high-quality software solutions while working with back end developers,
      product owners/business analysts, and fixing various issues while
      collaborating with the QA team. I’m adept at working with tools like Redux
      for state management, React Router for seamless navigation, and SASS for
      styling.
